Welcome, my name is <strong>Sarah</strong>. 
<br>Currently I am searching for opportunity to work as a QA Software Tester and I am based in Germany.

<h4>Let me tell you something: <i>I am not a classical IT person.</i></h4>
<p>My academic background is in the most human-centered field and began corporate career at HR. Then, I <i>accidently landed</i> in IT when the firm was under restructuring. I thought and hope it will only be a clash landing. It was a shocking transition at that time, without ever realizing this would become a <strong>fateful pivot</strong> that affects my entire career.</p>

<h4>What is technology and what does it mean to work in tech fields?</h4>
<p>It is about making our life better through connection. 
<br>A girl studied human languages, history and social interactions is now learning programming languages, history of tools and frameworks and the interaction between components of applications. This unique changeover is a good example of bridging worlds to connect - this reflects on, using the words of <i>Jean-Paul Sartre</i>, the <i>raison d'être</i> of technology. Working in tech industry means participating in the connection journey.</p>

<h4> ...and why Testing?</h4>
<p>Software Testing will be a great fit for me. I find the job itself represents myself: The combination of non-tech softskills & tech-savvy hardskills, attention to details, process oriented, thorough documentation and communication. Besides, it is a rewarding career in which I can contribute added value while ensuring product competence which leads to customer satisfaction and make their life easier. As a diligent learner, having <strong>ISTQB Foundation Level</strong> certification under my belt, I am motivated to take specialization paths such as <strong>Mobile Application Testing</strong> and <strong>Test Automation</strong>.</p>

<!-- that how the wheels are moving in phase by phase approach and the inter-dependencies between roles, deliverables and artifacts.  -->

<!-- <p>Being a global nomad, coming from Far-East to West has been shaping my personality of eagering to explore different fields, working hard, learning immensely, taking risks and responsibilities of the consequences. This is derived from my upbringing: Raised in the city Seoul, then a couple years during mid-teen, exposure to countries in South Pacific. Later spent high school and college years in a southern port city Busan, as a student had international encounters in Australia and Europe. After the study, came back to Seoul and then made all the way to Germany. The international and intercultural living, learning and working experiences will bring critical value into the most dynamic and diverse field like technology.</p> -->


<!-- <p>While working in IT&D area, I have realized that information technology is a fascinating area. Here I could learn the process driven IT project and change management. In the meantime the thirst was growing for more tech-savvy topics and I took a sabbatical break to allow myself enough time and environment for reshaping the career path. </p> -->
