Welcome, my name is <strong>Sarah</strong>. 
<br>

<h4>Let me tell you something: <i>I am not a classical IT person.</i></h4>
<p>My academic background is in humanities and began corporate career at HR. Then, I <i>accidently landed</i> in IT when the firm was under restructuring. I thought it will only be a clash landing, without ever realizing this would later become a <strong>fateful pivot</strong> in my life.</p>

<h4>What is technology and what does it mean to work in tech fields?</h4>
<p>It is about making our life better and closer through connection. 
<br>A girl studied human languages, history and social interactions is now learning programming languages, history and interaction of frameworks and tools. The unique changeover is a good example of connecting and bridging - this mentality would be, citing the words of <i>Jean-Paul Sartre</i>, the <i>raison d'être</i> of technology. To me, working in tech industry means participating in the connection journey.</p>

<h4> ...and why Testing?</h4>
<p>Testing will be a great fit for me. I find the job represents myself very well: The combination of non-tech softskills & tech-savvy hardskills, attention to details for verification and evaluation, process oriented work manner, thorough documentation and communication. Contribution to better quality is a very rewarding part of this job and I want to play the role in continuous improvement of applications. Putting <strong>ISTQB Certification</strong> under my belt, I am interested in <strong>Mobile Application Testing</strong> and <strong>Test Automation</strong> for further specialization.</p>

<!-- Moreover, I am very convinced that on top of the required technical hard skills in software development and testing, my transferrable skills which have been gained throughout my past tack of professional experiences will add significant values to the future projects. -->

<!-- that how the wheels are moving in phase by phase approach and the inter-dependencies between roles, deliverables and artifacts.  -->

<!-- <p>Being a global nomad, coming from Far-East to West has been shaping my personality of eagering to explore different fields, working hard, learning immensely, taking risks and responsibilities of the consequences. This is derived from my upbringing: Raised in the city Seoul, then a couple years during mid-teen, exposure to countries in South Pacific. Later spent high school and college years in a southern port city Busan, as a student had international encounters in Australia and Europe. After the study, came back to Seoul and then made all the way to Germany. The international and intercultural living, learning and working experiences will bring critical value into the most dynamic and diverse field like technology.</p> -->


<!-- <p>While working in IT&D area, I have realized that information technology is a fascinating area. Here I could learn the process driven IT project and change management. In the meantime the thirst was growing for more tech-savvy topics and I took a sabbatical break to allow myself enough time and environment for reshaping the career path. </p> -->
