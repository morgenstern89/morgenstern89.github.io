<p>Welcome to my website.</p>
<p>My name is <strong>Sarah</strong>. 
I have created this page to showcase my story, motivation, interests and skills to become a new software tester. Before navigating this site, let me first tell you a story: <i><strong>I am not a classical IT person.</strong></i>
</p>

<p>My academic background is in the most human-centered field and I started corporate career in Organizational Culture and Development. Then one day, I <i><strong>accidently</strong></i> landed in IT when the firm was under restructuring and after my then temporary contract was not extended as the management wanted to open more senior roles to reform the HR. Only one role was offering me a permanent job where I was repositioned at IT infrastrucrure department, waiting for the global service desk transformation worldwide. 
<p><strong> Hang on, a literature & sociology graduates will work for an IT team? </strong>
		<p>It was a shocking transition at that time, without ever realizing that this would later become a <strong>fateful movement</strong> in my entire career.</p>

<p>While working in IT&D division, I have realized that information technology is a fascinating area where even I as a woman can continue grow further. My previous roles in the division made me good basement to learn the IT project management processes, service management cycle and change management of global-scale IT organizational transformation that how the wheels are moving in phase by phase approach and the inter-dependencies between roles, deliverables and artifacts. However my ever-growing thirst in deepening into more tech-savvy areas was not achievable in the given set-up, therefore while maintaining the process-driven and administrative positions, privately I have invested in further development to gain IT sector knowledges and finally as of November 2021, I have decided to take a year sabbatical to actively prepare myself for reshaping my career path.</p>

<p>Among other technical career tracks, I found <strong>Software Testing</strong> is a great fit for me as the job itself seems a representation of myself: <strong>combination of tech-driven nature and non-tech softskills and the emphasis on attention to details, understanding process driven work flow, thorough documentation and communication.</strong> Since the beginning of 2022, I have been diligently taking different courses and accessing to various inspirational resources to enlighten myself to get positioned in my desired job. Moreover, I am very convinced that on top of the required technical hard skills in software development and testing, my transferrable skills which have been gained throughout my past tack of professional experiences will add significant values to the future projects. </p>

<p>Now, back to the beginning of my story - a girl who used to study human languages, history and social interactions is now growing as a budding tech professional who is learning programming languages, history of tools and frameworks and the interaction between components of applications. With this unique changeover which has happend in my career, I believe that I will play a key role bridging different worlds as a good tester who understands developers, designers, end-users and product owners. At the end, connecting the dots and becoming a bridge is, using the words of <i><strong>Jean-Paul Sartre</strong></i>, the **raison d'etre** of technology.</p>

<p>Being a global nomad, coming from Far-East to West has been shaping my personality of eagering to explore different fields, working hard, learning immensely, taking risks and responsibilities of the consequences. This is derived from my upbringing: Born in a satelite town near Seoul, South Korea and then raised in the city Seoul, then a couple years during mid-teen, exposure to countries in South Pacific. Later spent high school and college years in a southern port city Busan, as a student had international encounters in Australia and Europe. After the study, came back to Seoul and then made all the way to Germany. The international and intercultural living, learning and working experiences will bring critical value into the most dynamic and diverse field like technology.</p>

<p>I am continue learning mobile application testing with APPIUM as well as trying to absorb recent testing trends via multiple sources of information. After taking ISTQB foundation level certification, I am also motivated to take specialization paths such as Mobile Application Tester and eventually Test Automation Engineer.
