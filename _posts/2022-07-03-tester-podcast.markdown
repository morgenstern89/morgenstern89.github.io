## The Evil Tester Show
### Summary
    
The host <strong>Alan Richardson</strong> is a UK-based seasoned tester with abundant experience in the field. First I got to know him on YouTube as he has his a channel, soon I have learned that his podcast show is available on Spotify.
He is telling listeners about getting the first step into the job, test automation related topics, strategies on choosing right testing tools and many more.
