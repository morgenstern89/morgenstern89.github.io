## About Project

**Goal: Creating a complete branding design guide for a fictional client who runs millinery business.**

This work was the final project of the 1 year graphic design course at **OfG(Online-Schule f√ºr Gestaltung)** which I have earned the diploma with award.
Key components for a brand identity design such as logo, typography, packaging, stationery-set, web & SNS interface are included. 

The course ran **from the year 2017 to year 2018**.
