## Don't Make Me Think & The Design of Everyday Things
## Summary:
<img src="/assets/images/uxdesignbooks.png" width="200">
<p>
These two books are introduced during the webinars of UX Design course at UX Design Institute. Both are considered as "must-read" for not only usability designers, developers but also for whoever is working in product development fields. With these readings, I have gained insights on the importance of creating intuitive yet persuasive design that tells consistent stories to the users and thus make it "user-friendly". 
<p>Think as end-user sounds banal however, when it comes to your own project and you become a designer, you might realize there is certainly a considerable gap in the perspectives of both. The two of the books were good guides for such kind of situations that creators would encounter quite frequently.</p>
