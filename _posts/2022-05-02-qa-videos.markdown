## Summary:

<strong>Madeline Elaine's YouTube Channel</strong>
    
This is a YouTube channel of a young American influencer who used to transform her career from an English teacher at a local high school to a manual QA tester at a software company.
I have been knowing her channel since the year 2021 when I was preparing for resignation at the previous company and targeting my next career goal into Software Testing domain.
In her channel, she uploaded and shared many episodes on her 8 to 5 corporate manual QA tester home-office job and useful Q&A on how to move into the job field.
To me, her story was particularly compelling because she has studied literature and education which resembles to my undergraduates majors in humanities field and was able to switch career into tech field.
Also she is a young woman working in tech industry, which also has inspired and encouraged me a lot.
Also it covers trendy topics such as mobile application testing which is one of my interests.

The best episode for me was this one: 
[Why I Quit Teaching and How I Became a QA Analyst](https://youtu.be/9BqKZ_BRLVs)

Currently she no longer works at the company as a tester as she wants to pursue further degree at the graduate school.
