## About Project

The project was finalized in **June 2022**.

**Goal: The main purpose is to collect all the preparatory works in one place which had been done from different courses to prepare the career transformation to Software Tester.**

Besides, customizing a page based on an existing template was a great occasion to fine-tuning the front-end web development skills and knowledge on Git which have been obtained through courses. As Jekyll is a static site generator in Ruby, getting to know about it was additional learning point. 

This work was for creating a Github Page using Jekyll Theme [Indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo).
<br>In addition to this, I wanted to integrate another Theme for the online CV and for this I have forked a bootstrap template from [Orbit Theme](https://github.com/xriley/Orbit-Theme).
