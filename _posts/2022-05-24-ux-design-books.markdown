## Summary:

<strong><i>Don't Make Me think</i> by S. Krung</strong>
<p><strong><i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> by D. Norman</strong></p>
    
These two books are introduced during the webinars of UX Design course at UX Design Institute.
Both are considered as "must-read" for not only usability designers, developers but also for whoever is working in product development fields.
With these readings, I have gained insights on the importance of creating intuitive yet persuasive design that tells consistent stories to the users and thus make it "user-friendly".

For a better application with enhanced user experience, designers and developers need to think more actively simple and logical that no excessive steps and motions to be added.
When reading the books, I thought this makes perfect sense but as I began building my own UX design for the final project, soon I have realized that this simple theory is actually a very challenging.
Think as end-user sounds banal however, when it comes to your own project and you become a designer, you might realize there is certainly a considerable gap in the perspectives of both.
The two of the books were good guides for such kind of situations that creators would encounter quite frequently.
<p>
Particularly the author of <strong><i>The Design of Everyday Things</i><strong> is the co-founder of the world's leading research-based user experience organization<strong>Nielson Norman Group</strong>.
    During and after the reading, I used to read articles from the company's websites as well.</p>
