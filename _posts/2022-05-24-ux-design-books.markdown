## Summary:

<strong><i>Don't Make Me think</i> by S. Krug</strong>
<p><strong><i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> by D. Norman</strong></p>
    
These two books are introduced during the webinars of UX Design course at UX Design Institute.
Both are considered as "must-read" for not only usability designers, developers but also for whoever is working in product development fields.
With these readings, I have gained insights on the importance of creating intuitive yet persuasive design that tells consistent stories to the users and thus make it "user-friendly". Think as end-user sounds banal however, when it comes to your own project and you become a designer, you might realize there is certainly a considerable gap in the perspectives of both. The two of the books were good guides for such kind of situations that creators would encounter quite frequently.
