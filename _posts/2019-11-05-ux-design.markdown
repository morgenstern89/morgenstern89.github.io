**Goal:Understanding UX Design process and as a final outcome creating wireframe of a mobile application.**

After defining the user requirements through user research(interview, survey, usability tests), captured the gathered data and grouped these into an affinity diagram. Then came up with a customer journey map. Based on this, started drafting high-level sketch of a mobile flight booking app and then digitalized this into wireframe. 

This program was my first step closer to the Tech domain, however still without coding knowledge involved. During this time,  I have learned the understanding in **Digital Product Development Lifecycle** and **Design Thinking** as a work mentality. 

Based on the outcome, later on, I could further invest on more tech-savvy knowledge such as basic programming, agile software development approach and finally software test management which aligns with this framework.

This work was the final project of the program **Professional Diploma in UX Design** at **UX Design Institute**. My cohort of the program was enrolled in **Fall 2018** and completed with the **final examination in 2020**.
