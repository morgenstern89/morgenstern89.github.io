## Summary:

<strong>Guru99</strong>
    
In my opinion, many QA testers are already familiar with this website. The site provides numerous tutorials on testing and offers mock project on manual testing.
I particularly find their live real-time mock testing projects very well-prepared for the learners. After one registration, every day the learner receives an email from Guru99 with the steps of testing activities which will be covered.
In this project, I could take a glimpse on how everyday manual testing flow will be processed with many sample templates of important artifacts. (E.g. test cases, SRS documentation, etc.).
It was about a banking app for desktop and goes through the whole testing lifecycle phase by phase.


There are many other types of testing information, knowledge articles are available.
