## Summary:

<strong>Desi in Deutschland (YouTube Channel)</strong>
    
This is a YouTube channel of an Indian lady who is immigrated to Germany and is working as as software tester.
As I am also a female immigrant living in Germany and wanting to work in the same field, it was a pleasure to get to know her channel.
There is a difference though, that she already has career track in QA Testing prior to coming to Germany, nevertheless I could relate myself to many of her episodes.

My favorite playlist of the channel:
