## About Project

<!-- The project was finalized in **July 2022**.
 -->
**Goal: To learn mobile application test automation with the help of Webdriver IO and Appium, using Android emulator.**

The course covers both Android and iOS devices to automate test cases.
<br>I only have Windows PC and could not install XCode for iOS type, I could only practice android using Android Studio emulator. However, the principle of mobile app testing would be similar for both device types. 

- Mobile Automation with JavaScript
- Mobile Automation using WebdriverIO & Appium
-  Android application automation
-  Building & Optimizing test framework
-  BrowserStack Integration
-  GitHub Action CI Integration

<p>With <b>Appium Inspector</b>, I could link the device on the <b>Android Studio</b> emulator and can check element by element, copying <b>Xpath</b> and use it in test cases. I ran the test either directly on the <b>Visual Studio Code</b> terminal or <b>Window's terminal</b>.</p>

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/727446219?h=cdb901cb6b&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Test: creating &amp;amp; deleting a note"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
<br>The video has been recorded while running a test case of an Android note-taking app <b>ColorNote</b> on the device model <b>Pixel 3</b>.


<p><br>Then, on <b>BrowserStack</b>, I ran a test case.
<br>The video has been automatically recorded on BrowserStack.</p>

<br>Also, I have run the test on <b>GitHub Actions</b> through the <b>CI integration</b> and the test case has been passed.
