## About Project

**JAVA Practice**

**Goal: Understanding the basic of object oriented programming(OOP) language.**

This was part of a [**Software Testing Bootcamp**](/assets/images/bootcamp.jpg) course which was taken during February to March 2022. Particularly interesting part of the exercises was to learn the 'class' concept which objects can be categorized/ grouped in a class.

## Technique

Learned the very basic of **JAVA** as a programming language.
Instead of using **Eclipse**, for the first time the editor **IntelliJ IDEA** was introduced and it was very intuitive coding tool particularly for the beginners.
